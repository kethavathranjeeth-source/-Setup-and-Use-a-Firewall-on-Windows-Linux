 This assignment demonstrated the practical use of firewall tools on both Windows and Linux systems. 
  By applying, testing, and removing firewall rules, we learned how firewalls enforce traffic control, protect systems from unauthorized access, and ensure safe communication.
   Understanding firewall behavior is essential for system security and network administration.
