 #Explanation: How a Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall filters network traffic using the following mechanisms:
#Rule-Based Filtering
Firewalls compare incoming/outgoing packets against a list of rules:
•	If a packet matches a rule, the defined action (allow/deny) is taken.
•	Packets not matching any rule use the default policy.
#Stateful Inspection
Modern firewalls track active connections:
•	Only packets that are part of a valid, established connection are allowed.
•	Others are dropped.
#Port and Protocol Filtering
Firewalls inspect:
•	Port numbers (e.g., 22 SSH, 80 HTTP)
•	Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
Blocking a port means no traffic can use that port to communicate.
#Direction Filtering
Firewalls can filter:
•	Inbound traffic (from external to local)
•	Outbound traffic (from local to external)
 #Profiles/Zones
Depending on the network type:
•	Home (Private)
•	Work (Domain)
•	Public
Rules may apply differently.
